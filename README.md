This repository contains the R code (`analysis.R` file) underlying the BMJ's Rapid Response titled:

["There is a high probability of clinically important benefit in the primary composite outcome"](https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2400/rr)

by [Arthur M. Albuquerque](https://twitter.com/arthur_alb1), Carolina B. Santolia, and [James M. Brophy](https://twitter.com/brophyj)

## Getting started

All analyses were conducted in R (R Environment version 4.0.4). 

1.  To download all files and reproduce our analysis, we suggest cloning this repository. Here is a tutorial article in case you are not familiar with this process:

    *Vuorre M, Curley JP. Curating Research Assets: A Tutorial on the Git Version Control System. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science 2018;1:219â€“36.* [https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2515245918754826](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2515245918754826)

       After cloning this repository, open the `letter-to-the-editor_BMJ_heparin_COVID.Rproj` file and you will be able to run all files.
2. We used the R package [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to make this R project as reproducible as possible. In summary, {renv} guarantees that all required R packages for this project are downloaded to your computer in the necessary versions. Please check their ["Get Started" vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) in case you would like to learn more about it.
